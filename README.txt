Just some things I might add at some point if I ever feel like going back to this later on:
- Multi-Session - pause/unpause - freeze players in place and mobs, stop damage, pause despawnable items time
- Multi-User - can have many people on a team - lists of players
- Compass Editon - add approx. distance away
- Fix any other bugs
- Players can play in a new game or spectate another one.
- Allow same player to be able to have multiple sessions
- Make sure they can't play if a player is in another game OR offline.
- show players joining
- player list command
